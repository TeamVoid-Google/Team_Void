What is the GenAI Financial Assistant? 
This project is your personal AI-powered guide for making smarter investment decisions, specifically tailored for the Indian market. Think of it as a financial companion living in your phone (via an app like Flutter) or accessible through WhatsApp. Its main goal is to provide personalized information, answer your finance questions, keep you updated with relevant news, understand your comfort level with risk, and suggest investment strategies that suit you.

How Many Agents Are Used and What Do They Do? 
Instead of one giant AI trying to do everything, this assistant uses a team of five specialized AI "agents", each with a specific job: Main AI Agent (The Manager): This is the boss. It receives your messages, figures out what you need (like asking a question, wanting news, or updating your profile), and assigns the task to the correct specialist agent below. It manages the overall conversation. Q&A AI Agent (The Knowledge Expert): Ask this agent basic questions about finance and investing in India (like "What is a SIP?" or "How does PPF work?"). It answers your questions, learns what topics you're interested in, and can even find relevant YouTube videos or Google search results for you. News AI Agent (The News Reporter): This agent fetches real-time financial news, especially news relevant to India or specific companies/investments you like. It remembers what news you interact with to provide more relevant updates later. User Profile AI Agent (The Interviewer & Analyst): This agent is responsible for understanding you. It asks specific questions about your income, savings, loans, and attitude towards investment risk. Once it has all the answers, it calculates your "Risk Tolerance Score" (how much investment risk you're likely comfortable with) based on a defined scoring system. If it notices missing information, it asks the Q&A agent to prompt you for it. Investment Portfolio Suggest AI Agent (The Strategist): Based on the Risk Tolerance Score calculated by the Profile Agent, this agent suggests a personalized investment portfolio. It breaks down how much you might consider allocating to low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk options suitable for the Indian context (like FDs, Mutual Funds, Stocks, Gold, etc.). It can also adjust the portfolio based on your feedback (e.g., "I want less crypto").

How Does it Work (The Flow)? 
You Send a Message: You type a question or request (e.g., via Flutter app or WhatsApp). Main Agent Takes Charge: The Main Agent receives your message. Understanding Your Need: It analyzes your message to determine the intent (Are you asking a question? Requesting news? Answering a profile question?). Delegation: The Main Agent routes your request to the appropriate specialist agent (Q&A, News, Profile, or Portfolio). Central Brain (JSON File): All agents can read and write to a central file (a JSON document unique to you). This file stores your name, your answers to the risk profile questions, your calculated risk score, companies/investments you like, and a history of your interactions. This allows the agents to provide personalized responses and remember past conversations. Specialist Agent Acts: The chosen agent performs its task: Q&A Agent finds an answer, maybe searches Google/YouTube. News Agent fetches news using external APIs (like SerpApi). Profile Agent asks a pending question or calculates the score. Portfolio Agent uses your risk score to generate suggestions. Updating the Brain: The agent updates your JSON file with new information (e.g., saves the answer to a profile question, logs the news you received, stores the portfolio suggestion). Response: The specialist agent sends its result back to the Main Agent. Final Answer: The Main Agent delivers the final, formatted response back to you.

What About the Files and Logic? 
The project code is organized logically: src/agents/: Contains the core Python code and specific logic (including the prompts given to the AI) for each of the five agents described above. src/services/: Holds code that interacts with external APIs â€“ gemini_service.py talks to Google Gemini AI, serpapi_service.py handles Google/YouTube/News searches via SerpApi, and whatsapp_service.py (placeholder) would handle sending messages back via WhatsApp. src/data_manager/: Contains json_manager.py, responsible for reading your data from and saving updates to your unique JSON file in the data/ directory. src/core/: Includes shared logic like the risk_calculator.py function used by the Profile Agent. src/api/ & src/app.py: Sets up a web server (using FAST API) that creates API endpoints. This is how a Flutter app (/chat) or WhatsApp (/whatsapp-webhook) can communicate with the backend agents. config/ & .env: Manages settings and safely stores your secret API keys. test_flow.py: A useful script to test the agent interactions directly via the command line without needing the web server or a frontend app. run.py: A simple script to start the FAST API web server.

In simple terms, the logic involves the Main Agent acting as a traffic controller, directing requests to specialist agents who use Gemini AI (sometimes with external tools like search) and a shared JSON memory file to perform their tasks and generate personalized, context-aware responses.
